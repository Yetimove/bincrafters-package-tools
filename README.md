This branch of this repository contains files used by Conan Package Tools for all kinds of bincrafters builds.  These scripts are downloaded directly from github during the build process to allow for rapid testing and prototyping at this time.  Once they are more mature and stable, we will likely move the code to a proper python package and deploy via PIP.
